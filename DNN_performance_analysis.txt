Model Training Results - ASVspoof Binary Classification
Training Performance Summary
The model completed training with early stopping at epoch 23. The training process showed good convergence with the following key metrics:

Training accuracy: 99%+ (final epochs)
Validation accuracy: 95.49% (peak at epoch 13)
Test accuracy: 88.52%

Early stopping was triggered after validation performance plateaued, which helped prevent overfitting.
Dataset Characteristics
The test dataset exhibited significant class imbalance:

Spoof samples: 63,882 (89.7%)
Bonafide samples: 7,355 (10.3%)
Class ratio: Approximately 9:1 (spoof:bonafide)

This imbalance likely influenced model performance and bias toward the majority class.
Classification Results Analysis

Key Observations from baseline dnn perfomance

Class Imbalance Impact: The model demonstrates strong performance on spoof detection but struggles with bonafide classification due to the 9:1 class distribution.
Precision vs Recall Trade-off: High recall for bonafide samples (78%) indicates the model successfully identifies most real audio, but low precision (47%) suggests many spoof samples are misclassified as bonafide.
Overfitting Indicators: The gap between training accuracy (99%) and validation accuracy (95%) suggests some degree of overfitting.

Limitations and Future Improvements
Identified Issues

Class imbalance affecting bonafide detection accuracy
Potential overfitting based on train/validation performance gap
Limited feature engineering (basic MFCC only)

Proposed Improvements

Class Imbalance Handling: Implement class weighting or balanced sampling strategies
Feature Enhancement: Add delta and delta-delta MFCC coefficients
Architecture Optimization: Experiment with different hidden layer configurations
Regularization: Add dropout or L2 regularization to reduce overfitting

Conclusion
The baseline DNN model achieved reasonable performance (88.52% accuracy) for initial implementation. The results demonstrate successful learning of spoof detection patterns, with room for improvement in bonafide classification through addressing class imbalance and feature engineering enhancements.
