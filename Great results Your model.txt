Great results! Your model is training well. Looking at the output, I can see a few key observations:

**Training Performance:**
- The model converges quickly with high training accuracy (99%+)
- Early stopping kicked in at epoch 23, which is good for preventing overfitting
- Validation accuracy peaked around 95.49% (epoch 13)

**Test Results Analysis:**
- **Overall accuracy: 88.52%** - This is quite good for a baseline DNN model
- **Class imbalance**: You have 63,882 spoof samples vs 7,355 bonafide samples (about 9:1 ratio)
- **Performance per class**:
  - Bonafide detection: 47% precision, 78% recall
  - Spoof detection: 97% precision, 90% recall

**Key Insights:**
1. The model is very good at detecting spoof samples (which is the majority class)
2. It struggles more with bonafide samples due to class imbalance
3. The high recall for bonafide (78%) means it catches most real samples
4. The low precision for bonafide (47%) means many spoof samples are misclassified as bonafide

**Potential Improvements:**
1. **Handle class imbalance** - Add class weights or use balanced sampling
2. **Feature engineering** - Try delta and delta-delta MFCC coefficients
3. **Model architecture** - Experiment with different hidden layer sizes
4. **Regularization** - The gap between train (99%+) and val (95%) suggests some overfitting
